Overview
--------

YARN commands are invoked by the bin/yarn script. Running the yarn script without any arguments prints the description for all commands.

Usage: `yarn [SHELL_OPTIONS] COMMAND [GENERIC_OPTIONS] [COMMAND_OPTIONS]`

YARN has an option parsing framework that employs parsing generic options as well as running classes.

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| SHELL\_OPTIONS | The common set of shell options. These are documented on the [Commands Manual](../../hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/CommandsManual.html#Shell_Options) page. |
| GENERIC\_OPTIONS | The common set of options supported by multiple commands. See the Hadoop [Commands Manual](../../hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/CommandsManual.html#Generic_Options) for more information. |
| COMMAND COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Various commands with their options are described in the following sections. The commands have been grouped into [User Commands](#User_Commands) and [Administration Commands](#Administration_Commands). |

User Commands
-------------

Commands useful for users of a Hadoop cluster.

### `application`

Usage: `yarn application [options] `

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| -appStates \<States\> | Works with -list to filter applications based on input comma-separated list of application states. The valid application state can be one of the following: Â ALL, NEW, NEW\_SAVING, SUBMITTED, ACCEPTED, RUNNING, FINISHED, FAILED, KILLED |
| -appTypes \<Types\> | Works with -list to filter applications based on input comma-separated list of application types. |
| -list | Lists applications from the RM. Supports optional use of -appTypes to filter applications based on application type, and -appStates to filter applications based on application state. |
| -kill \<ApplicationId\> | Kills the application. |
| -status \<ApplicationId\> | Prints the status of the application. |

Prints application(s) report/kill application

### `applicationattempt`

Usage: `yarn applicationattempt [options] `

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| -help | Help |
| -list \<ApplicationId\> | Lists applications attempts for the given application. |
| -status \<Application Attempt Id\> | Prints the status of the application attempt. |

prints applicationattempt(s) report

### `classpath`

Usage: `yarn classpath [--glob |--jar <path> |-h |--help]`

| COMMAND\_OPTION | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| `--glob` | expand wildcards |
| `--jar` *path* | write classpath as manifest in jar named *path* |
| `-h`, `--help` | print help |

Prints the class path needed to get the Hadoop jar and the required libraries. If called without arguments, then prints the classpath set up by the command scripts, which is likely to contain wildcards in the classpath entries. Additional options print the classpath after wildcard expansion or write the classpath into the manifest of a jar file. The latter is useful in environments where wildcards cannot be used and the expanded classpath exceeds the maximum supported command line length.

### `container`

Usage: `yarn container [options] `

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| -help | Help |
| -list \<Application Attempt Id\> | Lists containers for the application attempt. |
| -status \<ContainerId\> | Prints the status of the container. |

prints container(s) report

### `jar`

Usage: `yarn jar <jar> [mainClass] args... `

Runs a jar file. Users can bundle their YARN code in a jar file and execute it using this command.

### `logs`

Usage: `yarn logs -applicationId <application ID> [options] `

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| -applicationId \<application ID\> | Specifies an application id |
| -appOwner \<AppOwner\> | AppOwner (assumed to be current user if not specified) |
| -containerId \<ContainerId\> | ContainerId (must be specified if node address is specified) |
| -help | Help |
| -nodeAddress \<NodeAddress\> | NodeAddress in the format nodename:port (must be specified if container id is specified) |

Dump the container logs

### `node`

Usage: `yarn node [options] `

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| -all | Works with -list to list all nodes. |
| -list | Lists all running nodes. Supports optional use of -states to filter nodes based on node state, and -all to list all nodes. |
| -states \<States\> | Works with -list to filter nodes based on input comma-separated list of node states. |
| -status \<NodeId\> | Prints the status report of the node. |

Prints node report(s)

### `queue`

Usage: `yarn queue [options] `

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| -help | Help |
| -status \<QueueName\> | Prints the status of the queue. |

Prints queue information

### `version`

Usage: `yarn version`

Prints the Hadoop version.

Administration Commands
-----------------------

Commands useful for administrators of a Hadoop cluster.

### `daemonlog`

Usage:

```
   yarn daemonlog -getlevel <host:httpport> <classname> 
   yarn daemonlog -setlevel <host:httpport> <classname> <level>
```

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| -getlevel `<host:httpport>` `<classname>` | Prints the log level of the log identified by a qualified `<classname>`, in the daemon running at `<host:httpport>`. This command internally connects to `http://<host:httpport>/logLevel?log=<classname>` |
| -setlevel `<host:httpport> <classname> <level>` | Sets the log level of the log identified by a qualified `<classname>` in the daemon running at `<host:httpport>`. This command internally connects to `http://<host:httpport>/logLevel?log=<classname>&level=<level>` |

Get/Set the log level for a Log identified by a qualified class name in the daemon.

Example: `$ bin/yarn daemonlog -setlevel 127.0.0.1:8088 org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.rmapp.RMAppImpl DEBUG`

### `nodemanager`

Usage: `yarn nodemanager`

Start the NodeManager

### `proxyserver`

Usage: `yarn proxyserver`

Start the web proxy server

### `resourcemanager`

Usage: `yarn resourcemanager [-format-state-store]`
